## Odin isn't responding to push-to-talk

**Check permissions first.** Go to the panel and click the shield icon. If Microphone shows a red status, re-grant it in System Settings.

**Check the hotkey.** Make sure you're holding, not tapping. The recording stops when you release the key.

**Check your microphone.** Open another app (e.g., QuickTime → New Audio Recording) to confirm your mic is working at the system level.

**Restart Odin.** Quit from the tray menu and relaunch.

---

## No audio response

**Check system volume.** Odin's audio plays through your default output device — make sure it isn't muted or at zero.

**Check if TTS is configured.** If the audio server is unreachable, Odin will respond without audio. You'll see the text in the panel history even if you hear nothing.

---

## Odin can't see my screen (no screen context in responses)

**macOS:** Screen Recording permission may not be granted. Go to **System Settings → Privacy & Security → Screen Recording** and enable Odin AI. Quit and relaunch Odin after granting the permission.

**Check if responses reference your screen content.** If Odin is answering without mentioning what's visible, this is the most likely cause.

## The cursor overlay triangle doesn't appear

- Confirm Screen Recording is granted on macOS.
- The overlay may be hidden behind a full-screen app. Try in a windowed app first.
- Restart Odin if the overlay was working and suddenly stopped.

## Act Mode isn't working / stops unexpectedly

Act Mode controls your mouse and keyboard in real time. If it stops:

- A CAPTCHA or 2FA prompt may have appeared — Odin will pause and ask you to complete it.
- The target page may have changed layout since Odin last captured it.
- Stop Act Mode via the panel and retry with a more specific task description.

---

## Background agent isn't running / no output

- Check the Agent Dock in the panel — the agent may have errored. Expand it to see the last output.
- Very long-running agents may time out. Break the task into smaller steps.
- If the agent needs to write files, confirm the destination path exists.

## High cost / many tokens

- Longer conversation histories and more screenshots increase token usage.
- Use `⌘K` (macOS) or `Ctrl+K` (Windows) to clear the conversation and start fresh.
- Choose a faster, lighter model in Settings for simple tasks.

---

## MCP server won't connect

- Check the server command is correct and the required binary/package is installed.
- Check that any required API keys or environment variables are set in the server config.
- Look at Odin's console log (open from the tray menu → **Developer → Open Logs**) for error messages from the server process.
